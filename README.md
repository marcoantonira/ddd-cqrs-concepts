Problem Domain - The specific problem the software you're working on is trying to solve.<br />
Core Domain - The key differentiator for the customer's business - something they must do well and cannot outsource.<br />
Sub-Domains - Separate applications or feautures your must support or interact with.<br />
<b>Bounded Context</b> - A specific responsibility, with explicit boundaries that separate it from other parts of the system.<br />
Context Mapping - The process of identifying bounded contexts and their relationships to one another.<br />
Shared Kernel - Part of the model that is shared by two or more teams, who agree not to change it without collaboration.<br />
Ubiquitous Language - A language using terms from the domain model that programmers and domain experts use to discuss the system.<br />
